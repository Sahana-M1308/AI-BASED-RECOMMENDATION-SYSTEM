DESCRIPTION:

Tools, Platform, and Applications Used for Task 4 (Movie Recommendation System) The Task 4 project demonstrates how Java can be used to process a CSV file containing movie ratings and provide simple movie recommendations based on genre. This program allows the user to input a genre, processes the ratings from the dataset, and then identifies the best movie for that genre while also listing the average ratings of all movies in the selected category. While implementing this program, several tools, platforms, and applications were involved to ensure smooth development and execution.

Programming Language – Java The primary tool used is Java, one of the most widely used object-oriented programming languages. Java provides inbuilt libraries and utilities to handle file input/output, string processing, collections, and user input. In this project, Java’s BufferedReader and FileReader classes are used to read the CSV file, while collections such as HashMap and ArrayList store movie ratings efficiently. Additionally, features like Streams API are used for calculating averages, demonstrating modern Java capabilities. Java is particularly suitable for such data processing tasks because of its rich standard libraries and platform independence.

Integrated Development Environment – Visual Studio Code (VS Code) The project was built and run inside Visual Studio Code, which is a popular and lightweight IDE. With the Java Extension Pack installed, VS Code supports Java syntax highlighting, error detection, debugging, and code completion. Task 4 involves working with multiple files (the .java source code and the CSV dataset file), and VS Code simplifies project organization using its explorer view. The integrated terminal of VS Code was used to compile (javac) and run (java) the program, allowing quick testing of the recommendation system. The configuration file provided (java.project.sourcePaths, java.project.outputPath, and java.project.referencedLibraries) ensures that the program structure is well defined, with src as the source folder and bin as the output folder for compiled class files.

Platform – Java Development Kit (JDK) The JDK (Java Development Kit) is the core platform required to compile and run Java programs. In this project, the JDK provides all necessary libraries for file handling, collection management, and console input. Without the JDK, it would not be possible to translate the source code into executable bytecode. It also ensures that the program runs consistently across any operating system that supports Java.

Dataset Handling – CSV File A major component of this project is the Recommendation.csv file, which stores user ratings for different movies across genres like Action, Drama, Comedy, Horror, and Fantasy. Each record contains the user ID, genre, movie name, and rating. The Java program reads this structured data, groups ratings by movie, and computes the average rating per movie. This approach mimics real-world recommendation systems where user preference data is processed to make suggestions.

Applications of the Project The Task 4 program is a simplified version of real-world recommendation engines such as those used by Netflix, Amazon Prime, or IMDb. Its applications include: Movie Recommendation: Suggests the highest-rated movie for a given genre. Educational Use: Demonstrates Java file handling, collection frameworks, and aggregation techniques for beginners. Data Processing Prototype: Can be extended to handle larger datasets, add personalized recommendations, or include collaborative filtering. Practical Utility: Useful for students and developers who want to understand how ratings data can be transformed into meaningful insights.
